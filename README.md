# maker-hub

This repository is a resource hub and playground for makers who use open source tools for **software development**, **digital design & simulation** and **hardware fab** (like PCB layout and 3D modeling/printing). It serves as a portal linking resources to supplement your making.

*(Note: This hub is under active development and content may be sparse for a while as resources are organised and added.)*


## Design, Sourcing & Manufacturing

* **[maker-parts-catalog](https://github.com/leonlafa/maker-parts-catalog)** - A catalog of electronic/hardware components with useful assets and datasheet links
* **[maker-kicad-libs](https://github.com/leonlafa/maker-kicad-libs)** - Original KiCad symbols, footprints, 3D models for global library use

## Learning & Educational Resources

* [sap1-logisim](https://github.com/leonlafa/sap1-logisim) - A simulation of a Simple-As-Possible (SAP) computer, implemented in Logisim Evolution.
