# maker-hub

This repository is a resource hub and playground for makers using open source tools for **software development** and **hardware design** (like PCB layout and 3D modeling/printing). It serves as a portal linking resources to supplement your making.

*(Note: This hub is under active development and content may be sparse for a while as resources are organised and added.)*

## Core Resource Repositories

This hub primarily points to these key areas:

1.  **[maker-parts-catalog](https://github.com/leonlafa/maker-parts-catalog)**
    * Curated index of electronic/hardware components with metadata & links

2.  **[maker-kicad-libs](https://github.com/leonlafa/maker-kicad-libs)**
    * Original KiCad symbols, footprints, 3D models for global library use

3.  **Projects & Examples**
    * Standalone project repos - Links Coming Soon!
